# ESLint Configuration Fix

This document explains the ESLint configuration fix that was implemented to resolve the GitHub workflow failure.

## Problem

The GitHub workflow was failing during the ESLint step with the following message:

```
âš  If you set up ESLint yourself, we recommend adding the Next.js ESLint plugin.
```

The exit code 1 indicated a linting error, suggesting that the Next.js ESLint plugin was missing or not configured correctly.

## Solution

We implemented the following solution:

1. **Added a proper ESLint configuration file**

   Created a `.eslintrc.json` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "extends": ["next/core-web-vitals"]
   }
   ```

2. **Used the existing Next.js ESLint configuration**

   The project already had the `eslint-config-next` package installed as a dev dependency in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     "eslint": "^8.55.0",
     "eslint-config-next": "14.0.4",
     ...
   }
   ```

## Why This Works

1. **Next.js ESLint Integration**
   - Next.js provides built-in ESLint integration through the `eslint-config-next` package
   - This package includes a set of recommended rules for Next.js projects

2. **Configuration File Format**
   - The `.eslintrc.json` format is the standard configuration format for ESLint
   - It's automatically recognized by both ESLint and Next.js

3. **Core Web Vitals Preset**
   - The `next/core-web-vitals` preset extends the base Next.js ESLint configuration
   - It adds additional rules to help improve Core Web Vitals scores

## Testing the Fix

To verify that the ESLint configuration is working correctly, you can run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This should now complete successfully without any errors.

## Related Changes

This fix has been incorporated into the Airtable to Supabase migration plan:

1. Updated `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_FIX.md` to include the ESLint configuration fix
2. Updated `AIRTABLE_TO_SUPABASE_MIGRATION.md` to mention the ESLint fix as part of Phase 1
