# Phase 2: Voice Endpoint Migration

**Date:** 2025-05-30T21:17:04Z
**Target:** pages/api/twilio/voice.ts
**Action:** Replace api-compat imports with direct Supabase imports

## Pre-Migration State
- ✅ Baseline captured and logged
- ✅ Enhanced logging active
- ✅ Mock fallbacks working
- ✅ Current behavior: HTTP 200 with TwiML response

## Migration Plan
1. **Replace imports** - Change from `lib/api-compat.js` to `lib/supabase.js` + `lib/monitoring.js`
2. **Add enhanced logging** - Track the migration step
3. **Test immediately** - Verify identical behavior
4. **Compare results** - Ensure no regression

## Functions to migrate:
- `getBusinessByPhoneNumberSupabase` → direct from `lib/supabase.js`
- `trackSmsEvent` → direct from `lib/monitoring.js` (though not used in this flow)

## Expected Outcome:
- Same HTTP 200 response
- Same TwiML content
- Removal of compatibility layer dependency
- Direct Supabase integration

## Rollback Plan:
If anything fails, revert the import changes immediately.
