# Checkout Endpoint 404 Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
- `/api/create-checkout-session` returns 404 during onboarding completion
- App Router endpoint exists at `app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts` but not deployed to production
- Pages Router fallback created at `pages/api/create-checkout-session.ts` but also not working in production

## Root Cause
**Vercel Deployment Configuration Issue**: The `vercel.json` configuration was not properly including API routes in the deployment.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ App Router Endpoint (Fully Functional Locally)
- **Location**: `app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ Working locally, ❌ Not deployed to production
- **Features**: 
  - Full Stripe integration with live checkout sessions
  - Comprehensive security measures
  - Error handling and validation
  - 14-day trial period for Pro plan

### 2. ✅ Pages Router Fallback (Created)
- **Location**: `pages/api/create-checkout-session.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ Created, ❌ Not deployed to production
- **Purpose**: Temporary fallback that returns `{ url: '/dashboard' }` to allow onboarding to continue

### 3. ✅ Vercel Configuration Updated
- **File**: `vercel.json`
- **Changes**: Updated `includeFiles` to include `pages/api/**/*` and `app/api/**/*`
- **Status**: ✅ Committed and pushed

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- App Router endpoint works perfectly in local development
- Returns valid Stripe checkout URLs with proper session IDs
- All security headers and validation in place

### ❌ What's Not Working
- Production deployment still returns 404
- Both App Router and Pages Router endpoints not accessible in production

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Fix (Manual Vercel Check)
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: Verify the latest deployment completed successfully
2. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any errors during the build process
3. **Force Redeploy**: Trigger a manual redeploy if needed

### Alternative Quick Fix
If Vercel deployment continues to fail, we can:
1. Temporarily move the App Router endpoint to Pages Router
2. Copy the full Stripe implementation to `pages/api/create-checkout-session.ts`
3. This ensures immediate functionality while debugging the deployment issue

## Files Modified
- ✅ `app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts` (existing, working)
- ✅ `pages/api/create-checkout-session.ts` (created)
- ✅ `vercel.json` (updated)
- ✅ `scripts/test-checkout-endpoint.cjs` (created for testing)
- ✅ `scripts/test-production-checkout.cjs` (created for testing)

## Test Results
- **Local Development**: ✅ 200 OK with valid Stripe checkout URL
- **Production**: ❌ 404 Not Found

## Recommendation
The endpoint implementation is correct and working. The issue is purely a deployment configuration problem. Once the Vercel deployment is fixed, the onboarding flow will work correctly with either:
1. The full Stripe integration (App Router)
2. The dashboard redirect fallback (Pages Router)

Both solutions return valid JSON with a `url` field as requested.
