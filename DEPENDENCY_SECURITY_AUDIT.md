   - `middleware/security.ts` - Request security middleware

### Usage Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive security audit
node scripts/enhanced-security-audit.js

# Run with verbose output
node scripts/enhanced-security-audit.js --verbose

# Simulate security fixes (dry run)
node scripts/enhanced-security-audit.js --dry-run

# Apply automatic security fixes
node scripts/enhanced-security-audit.js --fix

# Standard npm audit
npm audit

# Apply npm security fixes
npm audit fix

# Force fixes (may include breaking changes)
npm audit fix --force
```

## 📋 Security Best Practices Analysis

### Package.json Security Review

✅ **Strengths:**
- No risky scripts detected (no curl, wget, eval commands)
- Comprehensive dependency management
- Proper dev/production dependency separation

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**
- Many packages use version ranges (^/~) which may introduce vulnerabilities
- Consider pinning critical security-related packages to exact versions

### Dependency Management Recommendations

1. **Version Pinning for Critical Packages**
   ```json
   {
     "@auth0/nextjs-auth0": "4.6.0",  // Exact version for security
     "stripe": "14.5.0",              // Exact version for payment security
     "jsonwebtoken": "9.0.2"          // Exact version for auth security
   }
   ```

2. **Regular Security Monitoring**
   - Run `npm audit` before each deployment
   - Monitor GitHub security advisories
   - Set up automated dependency updates with security focus

3. **Production Security**
   - Use `npm ci` in production for reproducible builds
   - Implement dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
   - Regular security audits (weekly/monthly)

## 🔄 Automated Security Workflow

### Recommended Security Maintenance Schedule

**Daily:**
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security event monitoring via our audit system

**Weekly:**
- Run enhanced security audit
- Review and apply non-breaking security fixes
- Monitor security advisories for used packages

**Monthly:**
- Comprehensive security review
- Evaluate breaking change security fixes
- Update security documentation

**Quarterly:**
- Full dependency audit and cleanup
- Security infrastructure review
- Penetration testing consideration

## 🚨 Incident Response

### High/Critical Vulnerability Response

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   ```bash
   # Check current vulnerabilities
   npm audit
   
   # Apply automatic fixes
   npm audit fix
   
   # For critical issues, apply force fixes
   npm audit fix --force
   
   # Run comprehensive audit
   node scripts/enhanced-security-audit.js
   ```

2. **Validation Steps:**
   - Test application functionality after fixes
   - Run security infrastructure tests
   - Verify no new vulnerabilities introduced

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update this audit report
   - Log security events in audit system
   - Communicate changes to team

## 📊 Security Metrics Dashboard

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Vulnerability Resolution Time**: Target <24 hours for high/critical
- **Dependency Freshness**: Target <30 days for security updates

   - Compliance reporting

## 📝 Action Items

### Immediate (Next 7 Days)
- [ ] Consider Next.js upgrade path to 15.2.2+
- [ ] Implement weekly security audit schedule
- [ ] Add security audit to CI/CD pipeline

### Short Term (Next 30 Days)
- [ ] Pin critical security packages to exact versions
- [ ] Set up automated security monitoring alerts
- [ ] Create security incident response playbook

### Long Term (Next 90 Days)
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates
- [ ] Add advanced vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Develop security compliance reporting

## 🎯 Conclusion

The dependency security audit has successfully:

✅ **Fixed 1 moderate vulnerability** (Auth0 session invalidation)  
✅ **Implemented comprehensive security infrastructure**  
✅ **Created automated security monitoring**  
✅ **Established ongoing security maintenance procedures**  

The remaining low-severity Next.js vulnerability has minimal impact (dev-only) and can be addressed during the next major framework upgrade cycle.

**Overall Security Posture**: 🟢 **GOOD** - No high-risk vulnerabilities, robust monitoring in place, clear improvement path defined.
