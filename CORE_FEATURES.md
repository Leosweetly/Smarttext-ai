# SmartText AI - Core Plan Features

This document provides an overview of the Core Plan features implemented in the SmartText AI platform. The Core Plan is designed for solo operators and small businesses that want to stop losing leads from missed calls.

## Core Plan Features

### 1. Auto-text for missed calls
Automatically sends text messages to callers who didn't reach you, ensuring you never miss a potential lead. When someone calls and doesn't reach you, the system automatically sends a personalized text message to keep the conversation going.

**Test Script:** `scripts/test-missed-call.js`

### 2. Pre-built industry response templates
Industry-specific templates for auto shops, restaurants, trades, and more to save you time. These templates are designed to provide relevant and professional responses based on your business type.

**Test Script:** `scripts/test-industry-templates.js`

### 3. Two-way SMS Inbox
Mobile and desktop interface for managing text conversations with customers. This allows you to respond to messages from anywhere, whether you're at your desk or on the go.

**Test Script:** `scripts/test-sms-inbox.js`

### 4. Basic contact log + conversation history
Keep track of all customer interactions in one place. This feature maintains a record of all conversations with each contact, making it easy to reference past interactions.

**Test Script:** `scripts/test-contact-log.js`

### 5. Simple appointment booking link support
Share links that let customers book time with you without the back-and-forth. This streamlines the appointment scheduling process and reduces administrative overhead.

**Test Script:** `scripts/test-appointment-booking.js`

### 6. Tag and organize leads manually
Categorize and filter leads with custom tags to keep your contacts organized and easily searchable. This helps you prioritize follow-ups and manage your sales pipeline more effectively.

  - Body Font: Roboto Regular or Light (For body text, tooltips, and form inputs)
  - Base Font Size: 16px minimum for accessibility

- **Voice & Tone:**
  - Clear, confident, and grounded
  - Always helpfulâ€”never overhyped or complicated
  - Straightforward, dependable, respectful, and local-first

**Branding Update Script:** `scripts/update-branding.js`

## Verification

To verify that all Core Plan features have been implemented and are working correctly, run the verification script:

```bash
node scripts/verify-core-features.js
```

This script will:
1. Check if all test scripts for the Core Plan features exist
2. Run each test script to verify functionality
3. Provide a summary of the verification results

## Running Individual Tests

You can also run individual test scripts to verify specific features:

```bash
# Test auto-text for missed calls
node scripts/test-missed-call.js

# Test industry response templates
node scripts/test-industry-templates.js

# Test two-way SMS inbox
node scripts/test-sms-inbox.js

# Test contact log and conversation history
node scripts/test-contact-log.js

# Test appointment booking
node scripts/test-appointment-booking.js

# Test lead tagging
node scripts/test-lead-tagging.js

# Update branding
node scripts/update-branding.js
```

## Implementation Notes

Each feature has been implemented with a focus on:

1. **Simplicity:** Easy to use for small business owners who may not be tech-savvy
2. **Reliability:** Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. **Performance:** Optimized for quick response times
4. **Scalability:** Designed to grow with the business
5. **Security:** Protecting customer data and communications

The implementation follows modern web development best practices and uses a modular architecture to allow for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

## Next Steps

After verifying all Core Plan features, consider:

1. Running end-to-end tests with Cypress to ensure all features work together seamlessly
2. Conducting user acceptance testing with real users
3. Implementing Pro Plan features for businesses that need more advanced functionality
4. Setting up continuous integration to automatically run tests on code changes
5. Documenting the API for potential integrations with other systems
